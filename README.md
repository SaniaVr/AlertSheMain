# AlertShe
Welcome to the AlertShe project! This platform is designed to offer a safe space for women in emergency situations to communicate with each other, share experiences, and access valuable resources. This repository contains the frontend
part of the project

## About the Project
AlertShe is an online platform leveraging blockchain technology on the Polygon network for the backend and React for the frontend. Our mission is to provide a secure and supportive network for women, particularly those who have been victims of sexual assault. 
### Highlights
1. **Report Emergency**: Immediately call for help in emergency situations.
2. **Community Blogging**: Connect with others, share experiences, and find your community.

### Backend
We have used Polygon for the backend of this project. It utilizes solidity frameworks and is built on the ZkEvm Polygon Cardona Testnet.
The backend repository of the project can be viewed here- https://github.com/manyajsingh/backend-hob

### Inspiration
AlertShe was inspired by the need for a trustworthy platform where women can report incidents and access safety resources without fear of tampering. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a secure environment where women can share their experiences and support each other.
