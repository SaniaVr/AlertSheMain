### Backend
We have used Polygon for the backend of this project. It utilizes solidity frameworks and is built on the ZkEvm Polygon Cardona Testnet.
The backend repository of the project can be viewed here- https://github.com/manyajsingh/backend-hob

### Inspiration
AlertShe was inspired by the need for a trustworthy platform where women can report incidents and access safety resources without fear of tampering. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a secure environment where women can share their experiences and support each other.
